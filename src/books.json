This heartwarming story about the effects of the Christmas spirit will grow even the coldest and smallest of hearts. Like mistletoe, candy canes, and caroling, the Grinch is a mainstay of the holidays, and his story is the perfect gift for readers young and old. Irrepressible and irresistible. --Kirkus Reviews",

Dr. Seuss's beloved story teaches kids to speak up and stand up for those who can't. With a recycling-friendly Go Green message, The Lorax allows young readers to experience the beauty of the Truffula Trees and the danger of taking our earth for granted, all in a story that is timely, playful and hopeful. The book's final pages teach us that just one small seed, or one small child, can make a difference. Printed on recycled paper, this book is the perfect gift for Earth Day and for any child--or child at heart--who is interested in recycling, advocacy and the environment, or just loves nature and playing outside. Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not. Pretty much all the stuff you need to know is in Dr. Seuss. -President Barack Obama",

It just takes one yawn to start other yawns off. Dr. Seuss spins a sleep-tastic tale about a very small bug and a very big yawn that spreads and spreads. Meanwhile, the Audio-Telly-o-Tally-o Count adds up every sleeping creature from the country of Keck to the Castle of Krupp. First one, then seven, all the way to the billions and zillions, the Who's-Asleep-Count just keeps growing and growing! This book is a perfect bedtime story that will have the most reluctant readers laughing, and the most reluctant sleepers snoring! Ninety-nine zillion, nine trillion and two Creatures are sleeping!

Each time Bartholomew attempts to obey the king's order to take off his hat, he finds there is another hat on his head. Soon it is Bartholomew's head that is in danger . . . of being chopped off! While The 500 Hats is one of Dr. Seuss's earliest works, it is nevertheless totally Seussian, addressing subjects that we know the good doctor was passionate about: abuse of power (as in Yertle the Turtle), rivalry (as in The Sneetches), and of course, zany good humor!",

These rarely seen Dr. Seuss stories were published in magazines in the early 1950s and are finally available in book form. They include The Bippolo Seed (in which a scheming feline leads a duck toward a bad decision), The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga (about a rabbit who is saved from a bear by a single eyelash), Gustav, the Goldfish (an early rhymed version of the Beginner Book A Fish Out of Water), Tadd and Todd (about a twin who is striving to be an individual), Steak for Supper (in which fantastic creatures follow a boy home in anticipation of a steak dinner), The Strange Shirt Spot (the inspiration for the bathtub-ring scene in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back), and The Great Henry McBride (about a boy whose far-flung career fantasies are bested only by those of Dr. Seuss himself). An introduction by Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen traces the history of the stories, which demonstrate an intentional move toward the writing style we now associate with Dr. Seuss. Cohen also explores the themes that recur in well-known Seuss stories (like the importance of the imagination or the perils of greed). With a color palette enhanced beyond the limitations of the original magazines, this is a collection that no Seuss fan (whether scholar or second grader) will want to miss.",

A Seussian spin on a conventional fairy tale, The King's Stilts is as topical today as when it was first published in 1939. It's the story of a devoted king who works hard and plays hard--and whose entire kingdom is threatened when his beloved stilts are stolen and he is too distraught to do his job. Written in prose instead of rhyme (unlike Seuss's later works), The King's Stilts nevertheless addresses subjects that we know Dr. Seuss was passionate about throughout his life: duty (as in Horton Hears a Who and Horton Hatches the Egg); the abuse of power (as in The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins and Yertle the Turtle); deceit (as in The Bippolo Seed and How the Grinch Stole Christmas)--and even cats (as in The Cat in the Hat and I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today)! Follow the Good Doctor's advice: After a hard day of work, have fun with a great book like The King's Stilts!",

So whether kids are beginner or advanced colorers, there's something here for all skill levels. Perfect for rainy days or traveling, this is one book kids are supposed to draw all over!",

The search for him in different places is a delightful read-aloud. Little dogs like to play, right? But sometimes, they disappear. Why did he leave without his bone? Did he go to the dentist? Maybe he could not chew his bone anymore? Is he in the park?Where did he go?Kids will learn different places, objects, and simple questions and answers, but mostly, they will cry out a loud \"hooray\" when the funny dog is discovered at the end. Where? Well, just read...Here's what makes this book special: Each line is both in English and JapaneseThe story is simple and suitable for early age learningAll the illustrations are original, creative and super funPlus, there are EXTRA PAGES for coloring and drawing at the end of the bookAND SO MUCH MORE!Kids learn quickly and easily. With bilingual children's books, you set them up for success and expand their horizons from an early age! This dual language story is specifically designed to teach children new foreign words and phrases as you read to them. The book is also available in other languages. If you and your children like funny animals and a bit of seek-and-find, then you'll both love this charming story!Two Versions Of Japanese: This book is for bilingual language learning. It is edited in two versions. Considerations in the editing are following differences between English and Japanese grammar.Pronouns (I, you, he, she, me, him, her, etc.) are often dropped in the subject and/or object as well as in the possessive form in Japanese.There are different verb forms: polite, simple, dictionary form, etc., besides verb conjugations.Finally, there are sentence-ending particles to convey nuances.In the text, the first line in bold letters uses children's language, which is not generally taught in Japanese learning books. The second line in smaller letters includes pronouns and uses a polite form which is typically taught in Japanese language textbooks.For all kids ages 2+ learning English or Japanese as a second language._________ WHAT REVIEWERS SAY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE BOOK: \"Lovely illustrations.\" \"Cute illustrations and a playful story in two languages.\" \"A fun way to learn.\" \"This is an adorable book and a great way to introduce another language to children.\" \"Make learning effortless and fun.\"",

J. Kennedy's 'Snowflake Souffle' to the simple, surprising imagery of Valerie Worth's 'Sun' to Hopkins's own onomatopoeic 'Thunder,' [with] short lines, satisfying rhyme, and physicalness of the words.\"Weather is a Level Three I Can Read book. Level 3 includes many fun subjects kids love to read about on their own. Themes include friendship, adventure, historical fiction, and science. Level 3 books are written for early independent readers. They include some challenging words and more complex themes and stories.Lee Bennett Hopkins was an acclaimed poet and anthologist. His work was recognized with the Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association, the National Council of Teachers of English Excellence in Poetry for Children Award, the Christopher Award, and many more. As Lee Bennett Hopkins said: \"Poetry and I fit together. I can't imagine being without it. It is food and drink, it is all seasons, it is the stuff of all existence.\"",

Topsy and Tim have fun visiting the zoo and soon decide that all the zoo animals would make great pets. Mummy and Dad have other ideas, though!Read it yourself with Ladybird is one of Ladybird's best-selling series. For over thirty five years it has helped young children who are learning to read develop and improve their reading skills.Each Read it yourself book is very carefully written to include many key, high-frequency words that are vital for learning to read, as well as a limited number of story words that are introduced and practised throughout. Simple sentences and frequently repeated words help to build the confidence of beginner readers and the four different levels of books support children all the way from very first reading practice through to independent, fluent reading.Each book has been carefully checked by educational consultants and can be read independently at home or used in a guided reading session at school. Topsy and Tim Go to the Zoo is a Level 1 Read it yourself title, suitable for very early readers who have had some initial reading instruction and are ready to take their first steps in reading real stories. Each story is told very simply, using a small number of frequently repeated words.",

Rosie is presented with a challenge that she is not sure she can accomplish on her own. Through teamwork, trust and tenacity, Rosie and her friends accomplish their mission while discovering their own inner strengths. And little do they know that their new friends are on an important mission of their own!Beautifully illustrated in hand-painted watercolors, see Rosie and her friends come to life through the eyes of your younger ones.Originally written for children ages 3-9 years but appealing to 'tweens and teens, this classic story of love, patience, kindness, and tenacity will warm hearts of all ages.Reviewed by Jennifer Ibiam for Readers' Favorite(R) - April 7, 2022Eight inches of snow fell on the Callahan Farm overnight. Rosie the truck wanted to play with her friends in it. Unfortunately, they expected a storm the following night, and Farmer Jack enlisted the help of everyone to prepare for it. Rosie wasn't happy, but she helped. Later, while they were playing, Mayor Hope sent for Rosie to help bring in four reindeer trapped on a stranded train. The reindeer were on an urgent mission but couldn't brave the incoming storm. If the mission failed, many children would be sad. Would Rosie agree to help get the reindeer out of danger to a shelter? Would the storm stop the reindeer from their task? Find out in Rosie the Farm Truck by Victoria Scudder, illustrated by Kam Bayo.Rosie the Farm Truck by Victoria Scudder is a perfect Christmas children's story. However, the lessons in this picture book remain evergreen. It is a tale of kindness, teamwork, love, resourcefulness, courage, and healthy doses of confidence. I loved the beautiful illustrations and attractive choice of colors by Kam Bayo. The simple grammar and punchy sentences were catchy and easy to understand. Scudder awakened my imagination by creating living characters out of everything in the environment which I'm sure will excite children. Above all, this book reminds us never to second guess ourselves, as Rosie did. We must opt for a circle of people who would do everything to help us succeed, as we can only receive the energy we give. When we show up for people in difficult situations, we unlock another level of our own strength and uniqueness.",

But when the egg hatches, the Birds are in for a big surprise--Junior is the oddest-looking baby bird they've ever seen--with big, long jaws full of teeth and an appetite to match. In fact, he looks more like a baby alligator than a baby bird! Nevertheless, the devoted Birds run themselves ragged feeding Junior until he gets so big, he must leave the nest or it will collapse underneath him. But how can Junior fly without wings? To the delight of the Birds--and readers!--the dilemma is solved when Junior takes off from a branch overlooking a pond.",

A baby bird goes in search of his mother in this hilarious Beginner Book edited by Dr. Seuss. When a mother bird's egg starts to jump, she hurries off to make sure she has something for her little one to eat. But as soon as she's gone, out pops the baby bird. He immediately sets off to find his mother, but not knowing what she looks like makes it a challenge. The little hatchling is determined to find his mother, even after meeting a kitten, a hen, a dog, and a Snort. The timeless message of the bond between mother and child make P. D. Eastman's Are You My Mother? a treasured classic. Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.",

This is a perfect gift for P.D. Eastman fans and dog lovers of all ages! Originally created by Dr. Seuss himself, Beginner Books are fun, funny, and easy to read. These unjacketed hardcover early readers encourage children to read all on their own, using simple words and illustrations.

But when Gus's words end up causing confusion and chaos for the people on the ground, it's up to Sam to help Gus write his wrongs. Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning....provides interest, suspense and word repetition.

The Bear family has run out of honey, and Father Bear and Small Bear are sent to get more. But rather than just get some at the store as Mother Bear suggested, Father Bear decides to follow a bee and get fresh honey from the source. Early readers and established Berenstain Bears fans will lap up this sweet, adventurous (and misadventurous) tale.

When the Berenstain Bears set out to find the perfect spot for a picnic, Father Bear says he knows just the place. But each ideal location turns out to be a complete disaster, with a train roaring past or hordes of mosquitoes. At last they find a place with no pesky crowds or noisy planes, and nary a mosquito . . . until it starts to rain. With The Bears' Picnic, literary legends Stan and Jan Berenstain provide a red-and-white-checked tablecloth to enhance a giggle-filled escape.

He's not afraid of the dark, and he's definitely not afraid of something as silly as underwear. But when the lights go out, suddenly his new big rabbit underwear glows in the dark. A ghoulish, greenish glow. If Jasper didn't know any better he'd say his undies were a little, well, creepy. Jasper's not scared obviously, he's just done with creepy underwear.

As a translator, she helped the team communicate with members of the Shoshone tribe across the continent, carrying her child on her back the whole way. By the time the expedition arrived at the west coast, Sacagawea had proved that she truly was a trailblazer. This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great--the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves. Each book tells the story of one of America's icons in a lively, conversational way that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers and that always includes the hero's childhood influences. At the back are an excellent timeline and photos.",

The Big Book of Bugs is the first fact-filled book for children to explore the vast array of creepy-crawlies that share our Earth. In the first pages, children learn that bugs live nearly everywhere on the planet and gain tips on how to become a young bug spotter. As the book continues, the scenic compositions on each page are dedicated to key groups of bugs, including beetles, moths, butterflies, bees, snails, crickets, grasshoppers, worms, and spiders. Some spreads approach the world of bugs thematically, such as bugs that come out at night, baby bugs, and life cycles, how bugs hide and show off, and how some bugs love to live in your home. The conversational, funny text is also full of facts that will astonish children and adults, and accompanied by Yuval Zommer's colorful illustrations. Illustrated in color throughout",

Subsequent pages are dedicated to specific creatures, including sea turtles, whales, sharks, stingrays, and seahorses, and show varied life in specific habitats, such as a coral reef or deep sea bed. The Big Book of the Blue also explores the underwater world thematically, looking at animals in danger, learning how to spot creatures at the beach, and discovering how to do our part to save sea life.

                    "description": "The new installment in the popular Big Book series connects young readers from around the world by emphasizing that we all belong to the same planet Earth.The Big Book of Belonging is a timely celebration of all the ways that humans are connected to life on planet Earth. With children at the heart of every beautifully illustrated spread, this book draws parallels between the way humans, plants, and animals live and behave. We all breathe the same air and take warmth from the same sun, we grow, we adapt to the seasons, and we live together in family groups.Readers will be fascinated to learn that instead of using words to communicate, fava beans send chemical messages through their roots, Caribbean reef squid send warnings of danger and even declarations of love by changing color, and that adorable big-eyed primates called tarsiers make calls to one another over the noise of the rainforest that are too high-pitched for predators to hear. By putting children at the heart of the book's concept, author Yuval Zommer unites readers of the Big Book series from all corners of the world under one banner--of belonging to planet Earth. The book's gentle message of caring for nature will inspire readers of all ages and encourage a new generation of environmentalists to flourish. Illustrated in color throughout",

And that the incredible is everywhere, and in everything--waiting to be known, discovered, recognized. This beautiful tale by New York Times best-selling author Kobi Yamada and illustrator Elise Hurst encourages readers of all ages to slow down and look at the world with their hearts--to use their imagination to expand their vision. A companion to the beloved children's book Trying, Noticing follows a young girl and an accomplished painter as they learn to observe the beauty and magic in each day. It's a story that will encourage you to pay attention, to make new discoveries, and to explore the unknown. And it's also an invitation to look within, to your own hopes and dreams, and perhaps to discover even more.",

While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. This first book in the series begins the conversation on race, with a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple and interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas for extending this discussion.",

While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. This second book in the series begins the conversation on gender, with a supportive approach that considers both the child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple and interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas for extending this discussion.",

Jim the chimpanzee is in a terrible mood for no good reason. His friends can't understand it--how can he be in a bad mood when it's SUCH a beautiful day? They have lots of suggestions for how to make him feel better. But Jim can't take all the advice...and has a BIT of a meltdown. Could it be that he just needs a day to feel grumpy? Suzanne and Max Lang bring hilarity and levity to this very important lesson on emotional literacy, demonstrating to kids that they are allowed to feel their feelings. Jim Panzee is back and grumpier than ever in Grumpy Monkey: Party Time and Grumpy Monkey: Up All Night!",

Reynolds entices even the stubbornly uncreative among us to make a mark -- and follow where it takes us.Her teacher smiled. Just make a mark and see where it takes you.Art class is over, but Vashti is sitting glued to her chair in front of a blank piece of paper. The words of her teacher are a gentle invitation to express herself. But Vashti can't draw - she's no artist. To prove her point, Vashti jabs at a blank sheet of paper to make an unremarkable and angry mark. There! she says. That one little dot marks the beginning of Vashti's journey of surprise and self-discovery. That special moment is the core of Peter H. Reynolds's delicate fable about the creative spirit in all of us.",

In fact, it's just getting started.Praise for What Do You Do With an Idea?National best seller, appearing in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly.Gold medal winner of the Independent Publishers Award, the Washington State Book Award, and the Moonbeam Children's Book Award.

The two become great friends, romping in the fields, leaping bales of hay, and playing ring-around-the-rosy by Mud Pond. But when the big yellow tractor comes to the farm and replaces Otis, he is cast away behind the barn. . . until the little calf gets stuck in Mud Pond. Then there is only one tractor--and it's not big or yellow--who saves the day. It's little Otis!With gorgeous illustrations from the critically-acclaimed Loren Long, this charming and unforgettable story about everyone's favorite little tractor is the perfect bedtime read-aloud!",

                    "description": "FROM THE #1 BESTSELLING ILLUSTRATOR OF MATT DE LA PENA'S LOVE AND WATTY PIPER'S CLASSIC THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD On the farm where Otis the tractor lives, the farmer has introduced someone new--a scarecrow to shoo away the pesky crows. But when Otis and the animals greet the scarecrow with friendly smiles, the scarecrow's frown never leaves his face. So everyone leaves him alone. Then one day, when a cold autumn rain sets in, Otis and the animals snuggle close and play Otis's favorite game: the quiet game. Otis knows the puppy and ducks can't sit still for long, and soon the farm friends begin to giggle and squirm, feeling warmed by one another's friendship . . . but on this day, Otis can't seem to take his eyes off the lonely figure in the cornfield. A deeply resonant book about subtle acts of compassion and standing up for others, featuring everyone's favorite tractor, Otis. Praise for OTIS AND THE SCARECROW: \"Otis the tractor's goodhearted nature continues to shine in his fifth picture book.\" -Publishers Weekly \"Readers will enjoy this sixth tale of an admirable leader who does the right thing with quiet confidence.\" -Booklist \"Teachers will see the connection between the lonely scarecrow and the outsider in the classroom and will be able to find many uses for this volume in the curriculum. Fans will enjoy this more cerebral Otis and might build a little empathy along the way.\" -Kirkus Reviews \"Loren Long creates a perfect book for the beginning of the school year with \"Otis and the Scarecrow.\"--Examiner.com",

                    "description": "The #1 bestselling illustrator of Matt de la Pena's Love and the creator of Otis presents an homage to firefighters everywhere--and to the many boys and girls who dream big of being heroes!On the farm where Otis the tractor lives, it hasn't rained in a long time and farmers all over the valley have grown anxious with water in such short supply. One hot afternoon, when Otis and his friends are resting beneath the shade of the apple tree, Otis spots something moving down in the valley--an orange tabby cat headed straight for the old barn. But then Otis sees something else that causes his engine to sputter . . . a swirl of smoke coming from the same barn. A fire!As Otis races toward the fire with his friends in tow, he spots the tabby cat mewing in alarm. Otis rushes inside to discover the source of the cat's worries--her little kittens are perched up on the hayloft, scared. Otis never hesitates. Yet even after he delivers a tractor full of kittens safely outside, their mama remains upset. Re-entering the burning barn, Otis discovers why: one tiny kitten, still too scared to move. With a friendly chuff, Otis coaxes her down and she scampers out the door. That's when the floor collapses with a CRASH, trapping the tractor. Now Otis, the friend everyone can count on, must count on his friends.Told with a sense of play and devotion, this is a heartwarming tale that reminds readers that sometimes even those who we count on to help us need a little help themselves. From the creator of Otis, Otis and the Puppy, and the illustrator of The Little Engine That Could and Of Thee I Sing by President Barack Obama.Loren Long wrote this story as a tribute to the firefighters who, like Otis, rescue people every day with their strength and bravery. Of course, people who aren't first responders should never go into a burning building for any reason. Reading this story to children is a great opportunity to discuss fire safety.Praise for Otis and the Kittens* \"As always, perseverance, teamwork, and a heart of gold pay off for Otis and his friends. When read aloud, the text flows off the tongue with sounds and words that extend the imagery created in the attractive gouache and pencil illustrations. The compositions make great use of perspective and motion and are expertly laid out . . . There are wonderful textured details that bring the story to life. [T]he perfect lapsit read-aloud, combining the ever-popular subjects of tractors, farm animals, and firefighters.\"--School Library Journal, STARRED REVIEW\"Long's seventh bucolic tale of an antique tractor with a smiling face and a good heart will please the little chuffer's many fans. The dynamic, fluid illustrations with a retro-rural vibe bring to mind Norman Rockwell's America with a Saturday comics spin. The theme of teamwork played out several times through the tale is communicated as simply as the tale itself. Keep on puffin', Otis!\"--Kirkus Reviews\"Long creates a powerful sense of suspense and danger as charcoal smoke gathers in the sky and bright flames lick the beams of the barn as Otis goes to work, but bravery, loyalty, and gritty determination are the real stars of the story--traits that Otis and his animal friends have in ample supply.\"--Publishers Weekly",

This particular giraffe was a fussy eater and refused to eat anything except mangoes. One day, Giraffe had runny tummy because she ate too many mangoes. Her friends then told her to try eating honey because that would help her settle the problem. She goes to a hole in a tree and pushes her head in to get tasty runny honey, but her head gets stuck.Giraffe's friends try to pull her out of the tree. They pull her legs, but she still cannot be free, she is stuck. She then passes the time playing games with her friends and eventually the tree she is in grows around her, causing her neck to stretch. Eventually, she manages to break free from the tree, but she is completely different. Now, she is tall and thin. She is tall enough to look for food that is on top of the trees instead of mangoes.Read it Yourself: Why Giraffe Has A Long Neck - Level 1 is a level 1 book which means that this is meant for children who are just beginning reading. This book was published by Penguin UK in 2013.

What happens when a tiny chick hatches out and they try to find its mummy?Read it yourself with Ladybird is one of Ladybird's best-selling reading series. For over thirty-five years it has helped young children who are learning to read develop and improve their reading skills.Each Read it yourself book is very carefully written to include many key, high-frequency words that are vital for learning to read, as well as a limited number of story words that are introduced and practised throughout.

All-new, first reference titles complete the range, with information books about favourite subjects that even the most reluctant readers will enjoy.Each book has been carefully checked by educational consultants and can be read independently at home or used in a guided reading session at school. Further content includes comprehension questions or puzzles, helpful notes for parents, carers and teachers, and book band information for use in schools.The Lost Egg is a Level 1 Read it yourself book, suitable for very early readers who are ready to take their first steps in reading real stories. Each simple story uses a small number of frequently repeated words.",

In fact, it's just getting started.Praise for What Do You Do With an Idea?National best seller, appearing in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly.Gold medal winner of the Independent Publishers Award, the Washington State Book Award, and the Moonbeam Children's Book Award.

They're excited to be on their own, but as they get ready for bed, Handa feels more and more nervous. She keeps hearing things - strange snorts, chitter chattering, a big thud. Akeyo says it's only her noisy family, but on the opposite page the reader sees the nocturnal animals who are really making the noise - and while some of them are familiar, others are very peculiar-looking indeed!With rich, night-time illustrations, sound effects, and plenty of curious animals, Handa's Noisy Night demands to be read aloud and shared - whether in the classroom or tucked up in bed at home.",

They feel terrible! OKAPI loves spending carefree days frolicking in the African Rainforest alongside his best friend AFRICAN GREY PARROT. One day, he meets a CHIMPANZEE who laughs at his striped legs and teases that he's stolen a zebra's pants. OKAPI has never met a ZEBRA and pretends he doesn't care, but the seed is planted, and he soon finds himself questioning the very stripes he used to love. What choice does he have but to set out in search of this strange zebra animal and see for himself if he has in fact accidentally taken its pants. On the surface, \"Okapi Loves His Zebra Pants\" is about an Okapi dealing with hurt feelings from being teased, but look deeper, and it's a story about resilience, self-acceptance, community, and finding joy in our similarities as well as our differences.Kids love the fact-filled spread at the end of the story where they can learn about okapis, chimpanzees and African grey parrots, ways to help endangered animals, and even how to draw them! Endangered & Misunderstood is an ongoing series of children's picture books that takes a different approach to the serious subject of lesser-known endangered animals, with an emphasis on laughter, adventure, and themes everyone can relate to. Buy and review \"Okapi Loves His Zebra Pants\" to help the endangered okapi. All proceeds go towards the protection and conservation of okapis.",

When his mother disagrees, the naughty pup waits for her to fall asleep and sneaks away. Outside, he meets a mischievous DIK DIK who is eager to show him some fun. However, DIK DIK's idea of fun isn't necessarily PANGOLIN proof and Pangopup finds himself in more and more danger as their explorations of the African landscape take them further from his burrow.On the surface \"Adventures of a Pangolin\" is about a naughty pangolin who thinks he knows better than his mom. But look deeper, and it's a story about kindness, navigating peer pressure, learning from our mistakes, and above all the power of unconditional love.Kids love the fact-filled spread at the end of the story where they can learn about the pangolin and dik dik, ways to help endangered animals, and even how to draw them!

Earth's Best Friend is a light-hearted nonfiction picture book about the formation and history of the moon--told from the perspective of the moon itself.Meet Moon! She's more than just a rock--she's Earth's rock, her best friend she can always count on. Moon never turns her back on her friend (literally: she's always facing Earth with the same side!). These two will stick together forever. With characteristic humor and charm, Stacy McAnulty channels the voice of Moon in this next celestial autobiography in the Our Universe series. Rich with kid-friendly facts and beautifully brought to life by Stevie Lewis, this is an equally charming and irresistible companion to Earth! My First 4.54 Billion Years and Sun! One in a Billion.",

Earthlings Welcome is a light-hearted nonfiction picture book about the red planet--told from the perspective of Mars himself...Meet Mars! The red planet. Planet Marvelous. Favorite sibling of Earth (or so he claims). Sometimes they're close (just 34.5 million miles apart). Sometimes they need space (250 million miles apart)! Earth and Mars have a lot in common--clouds, mountains, polar icecaps. And while Earth has Earthlings, Mars makes a persuasive case for why people should make the journey to spend time with him. His day is 7 minutes longer! He is home to the largest volcano in the whole solar system. He's, well, marvelous. With characteristic humor and charm, Stacy McAnulty channels the voice of Mars in this next celestial autobiography in the Our Universe series. Rich with kid-friendly facts and beautifully brought to life by Stevie Lewis, this is an equally charming and irresistible picture book.",

It encourages positive behaviour by using the concrete concept of an 'invisible bucket' that holds your good thoughts and feelings. When you do something kind, you fill someone's bucket; when you do something mean, you dip into someone's bucket and remove some good thoughts and feelings. This book focuses on how our social interactions positively or negatively affect others and encourages all to be kind.",

Until one day, his short arms can't reach the monkey bars, he can't find anyone during hide-and-seek, AND he's too little to ride the big slide. Ravi is so mad -- so furious -- that he can't control his temper anymore . . . and he turns into a ferocious, roaring TIGER!Tigers can do anything they want! But who wants to play with a growling, wild tiger who won't share or behave? Ravi is about to discover something very important about voicing his feelings.While we all get angry sometimes, Ravi's Roar shows some good ways to channel those emotions to avoid hurting family and friends.The Big Bright Feelings picture book series provides kid-friendly entry points into emotional intelligence topics -- from being true to yourself to dealing with worries, managing anger, and making friends. These topics can be difficult to talk about. But these books act as sensitive and reassuring springboards for conversations about mental and emotional health, positive self-image, building self-confidence, and managing feelings.Read all the books in the Big Bright Feelings series!Ruby Finds a WorryPerfectly NormanRavi's RoarMeesha Makes FriendsTilda Tries Again",

Little Red Hen wants help planting and cutting the wheat, grinding the flour and making the bread, but the cat, the rat and the dog refuse to join in - until the bread needs eating!For over thirty-five years it has helped young children who are learning to read develop and improve their reading skills.Each Read it yourself book is very carefully written to include many key, high-frequency words that are vital for learning to read, as well as a limited number of story words that are introduced and practised throughout. Simple sentences and frequently repeated words help to build the confidence of beginner readers and the four different levels of books support children all the way from very first reading practice through to independent, fluent reading.Each book has been carefully checked by educational consultants and can be read independently at home or used in a guided reading session at school. Further content includes comprehension puzzles, helpful notes for parents, carers and teachers, and book band information for use in schools.",

The story offers a way in to talk about what respect is and why it is important, reinforcing good behaviour. At the end of the story, there are notes for parents and teachers with suggestions of ways to help children deal with the big emotions they experience. Arin really struggles with showing respect for his own possessions or those of others. He doesn't see why he should respect other people's space or opionions either. But when everyone gets upset with him, Arin feels upset, too. Grandpa helps to explain how being respectful shows care for others, and how treating others how he wishes to be treated himself will make him, and others, feel happier.This book is part of a series, OUR EMOTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR, which is perfect for sharing with children as a gentle means of identifying and discussing their emotions, boosting their confidence and helping social and emotional development. Each book has a fun story which is backed up by suggestions for activities and ideas to talk through together and a wordless storyboard for children to tell a story themselves and reinforce the story's message. The series supports the Personal, Social and Emotional Development Area of Learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage.",

The story offers a way in to talk about our frustrations and how we can manage them, reinforcing good behaviour. At the end of the story, there are notes for parents and teachers with suggestions of ways to help children deal with the big emotions they experience. Maisy hates waiting for anything. She gets really cross if she has to wait her turn, at school or at home. When her sister Lola is late, and then Maisy has to wait for her to play, Maisy is really cross and upset. Lola teaches her some ways to be more patient. But will Maisy be able to show more patience at the park the following day?This book is part of a series, Our Emotions and Behaviour, which is perfect for sharing with children as a gentle means of identifying and discussing their emotions, boosting their confidence and helping social and emotional development. Each book has a fun story which is backed up by suggestions for activities and ideas to talk through together and a wordless storyboard for children to tell a story themselves and reinforce the story's message. The series supports the Personal, Social and Emotional Development Area of Learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage.",

Some kids sculpt sandcastles. Some make mud pies. Some construct great block towers. But none are better at building than Iggy Peck, who once erected a life-size replica of the Great Sphinx on his front lawn! It's too bad that few people appreciate Iggy's talent--certainly not his second-grade teacher, Miss Lila Greer. It looks as if Iggy will have to trade in his T-square for a box of crayons . . . until a fateful field trip proves just how useful a master builder can be. A story told in verse, this is a book that shows the power of education and science. Iggy, a child who once built a great tower--in only an hour--with nothing but diapers and glue. The structured rhymes and lively illustrations fit the architectural theme, and the text uses absorbing details of Iggy's world to bring the tale to life.

For over thirty-five years it has helped young children who are learning to read develop and improve their reading skills. Each Read it yourself book is very carefully written to include many key, high-frequency words that are vital for learning to read, as well as a limited number of story words that are introduced and practised throughout. Simple sentences and frequently repeated words help to build the confidence of beginner readers and the four different levels of books support children all the way from very first reading practice through to independent, fluent reading.There are more than ninety titles in the Read it yourself series, ranging from classic fairy tales and traditional world stories to favourite children's brands such as Peppa Pig, Kung Fu Panda and Peter Rabbit. A range of first reference titles complete the series, with information books about favourite subjects that even the most reluctant readers will enjoy. Each book has been carefully checked by educational consultants and can be read independently at home or used in a guided reading session at school. Further content includes comprehension questions or puzzles, helpful notes for parents, carers and teachers, and book band information for use in schools. Gus and Ross is a Level 0 Read it yourself book, designed for children who are developing their synthetic phonics skills. Steps 1 to 12 introduce letters and sounds in a systematic order.",

Moving from \"Sun Breath\" to \"Cloud Gathering\" to \"Ladybug & Butterfly\" and more, readers learn techniques for self-soothing, relaxing the body and mind, focusing attention, and other skills that will support restful sleep and improve overall confidence and well-being.",

Reynolds entices even the stubbornly uncreative among us to make a mark -- and follow where it takes us.Her teacher smiled. Just make a mark and see where it takes you.Art class is over, but Vashti is sitting glued to her chair in front of a blank piece of paper. The words of her teacher are a gentle invitation to express herself. But Vashti can't draw - she's no artist. To prove her point, Vashti jabs at a blank sheet of paper to make an unremarkable and angry mark. There! she says. That one little dot marks the beginning of Vashti's journey of surprise and self-discovery. That special moment is the core of Peter H. Reynolds's delicate fable about the creative spirit in all of us.",

Anytime. Anything. Anywhere.Drawing is what Ramon does. It's what makes him happy. But in one split second, all that changes. A single reckless remark by Ramon's older brother, Leon, turns Ramon's carefree sketches into joyless struggles. Luckily for Ramon, though, his little sister, Marisol, sees the world differently. She opens his eyes to something a lot more valuable than getting things just right. Combining the spareness of fable with the potency of parable, Peter Reynolds shines a bright beam of light on the need to kindle and tend our creative flames with care.",
